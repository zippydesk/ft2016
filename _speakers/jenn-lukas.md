talk_description: "<p>This talk gives some background and overview to the current state and future state of responsive images. I talk about issues and solutions around performance and production when handling images.</p><p>We also talk communication and responsibility, as one of the tricky things about images is that often people wonder &quot;who&apos;s responsibility is this?&quot; Design? Content? Development? Spoiler alert: everyone!</p><p>We&apos;ll talk image format solutions and how and when to use different solutions (SVG, srcset, picture). How CDN&apos;s can help. We&apos;ll also incorporate some fun things we can do with images and CSS and neat effects dealing with images as a content source. This covers development, design, and UX topics. </p>"
