talk_title: "Syntax Highlight Everything"
talk_description: "<p>A developer employs syntax highlighting to visually differentiate portions of her code; for centuries, designers, printers, and scribes have done the same for readers. Today, advanced features built into fonts can subtly signify types of content, increase a text’s authority, and are actually necessary for many languages.</p><p>This talk introduces designers and developers to highlighting syntaxes beyond code. Learn how to access these advanced typographic features using CSS and JavaScript, and—more importantly—where to apply them.</p>"
