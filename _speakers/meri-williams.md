<p>Meri is a geek, a manager, and a manager of geeks. She's a CTO and also manages her own micro-consultancy <a href="http://www.chromerose.co.uk/">ChromeRose</a> which helps digital & technical teams be brilliant. Previously she led the Delivery Team at the Government Digital Service and worked in Procter & Gamble’s Global Business Services organisation for 10 years, starting out as a dev, moving on to Product Management, and finally Programme & Engineering/Operations Management. She’s led teams ranging in size from 30 to 300, mostly with folks spread across the world.</p>
<p>She studied Computer Science with a focus on artificial intelligence, after a childhood full of hardware geekery, and so likes to mess with robots and soldering irons.</p>
<p>A published author and international <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/geek_manager/">speaker</a>, she sponsors scholarships to help more girls start STEM careers in her hometown of Stellenbosch, South Africa. In her spare time she enjoys baking, gaming, surfing, and her current obsession with hot smoking Texas-style BBQ.</p>
