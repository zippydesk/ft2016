talk_title: "Pixel Bonding"
talk_description: "<p>The experience of interacting should be more than just a click. Users want an experience that gives emotional feedback, that makes a connection. When this happens, the experience becomes powerful. One that leads them to bond with the experience. A bonded user is not only invested but is also engaged in the interaction. In this talk I’ll explore what bonding is, why it’s important to us and and how you can start pixel bonding.</p>"
