<p>Need to convince someone that a Front-Trends ticket and time off is worth it? Copy paste this text into an email or proposal to justify what it’s all about.</p>
<h3>Dear _____,</h3>
<p>On May 18-20 2016, I’d like to attend one of the best front-end developers’ conferences in Europe. I’ll be part of an annual gathering of web and mobile developers, UI/UX designers, graphics designers, JavaScript, HTML, CSS gurus, and professionals from all over the world.</p>
<h3>Front-End Trends</h3>
<p>In the last few years, front-end technologies have taken over the leading role in many projects’ development cycle. Whether it’s UX activities that can skyrocket conversion rates, or development of a single-page application that requires efficient and safe code, front-end contribution to software today is greater than ever before, and the industry is quickly moving forward.</p>
<h3>I’ll learn directly from industry experts and professionals</h3>
<p>At the 3-day event, I’ll meet the best-of-the-best in the industry, learn directly from the experts, and bring back real value to my work. I’ll be among 500 other talented professionals that do similar work to me, and I can ask questions, offer advice, and build a stronger knowledge network.</p>
<h3>I’ll bring back direct value to my work</h3>
<p>Front-Trends contains the latest trends and practices in front-end technology. I’ll see live coding sessions, see how the pros have solved challenging tasks, and how I can leverage their tricks and methodologies to improve my own work.</p>
