<p>Front-Trends is brought to you by people who love the web and modern tech. We are professional frontend developers, authors, tech writers, designers and product owners. In our spare time, we put together an annual conference with forward-thinking people that we hope builds strong relationships and inspired work among the frontend community.</p>
<p>Every year, Front-Trends runs a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}volunteer-at-front-trends">volunteer program</a> to staff the event. Students, newbie developers, or those who want experience organizing a professional frontend conference can apply. Participation is free in exchange for staffing the event. If youâ€™re interested in volunteering, let us know at staff@front-trends.com.</p>
