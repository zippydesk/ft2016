  <h2>00ps!</h2>
  <p></p>Looks like something didn’t work as expected and your payment didn’t get through. If you know what might have gone wrong, go to the <a href="http://zippydesk.github.io/ft2016/register">registration page</a> and try again. Depending on the payment method you chose, a problem could be laying on the payment provider’s side.</p>
  <p>You can also try processing the payment again by clicking <q>Pay online</q> on the Proforma invoice you received by e-mail.</p>
  <p>If, however, you think the problem is on our side, please email us at <a href="mailto:tickets@front-trends.com">tickets@front-trends.com</a> with the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When did the problem occur? What screen were you on that led you to this site?</li>
    <li>Did you see any error message or code? Do you remember what it said?</li>
    <li>If the paymant was with a PayPal account: do you have enough funds?</li>
    <li>If the payment was with a credit card: did you provide all data associated with the card you tried paying with?</li>
  </ul>
