<h2>Hints from the organizers</h2>
<p>Whether you become a Front-Trends speaker or not, the tips below will be useful for any speaking gig in the future.</p>

<h3>Technicalities</h3>
<p>Never depend on the conference <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znxQOPFg2mo">Wi-Fi</a></strong> connection. <strong>Live coding</strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzDDO3Xb_QU">demoing</a></strong> is tricky. Once you’ve lost your flow, it’s difficult to recover. Yet, there are <a href="https://vimeo.com/105955605">amazing examples</a> of live coding sessions. Just make sure you have a backup plan offline, and <strong>prepare screencasts</strong> that can be rapidly switched to if you encounter problems.</p>
<p>Provide enough contrast in <strong>your slides</strong>, use reasonable <a href="http://www.lauramfoley.com/wordpress/how-much-text-on-a-slide-is-too-much/">amount of text</a>, and keep it big and bold. We’ll display them on a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/front-trends/19175872151/in/album-72157654676120940/lightbox/">big</a>, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/front-trends/19175373491/in/album-72157654676120940/lightbox/">bright</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/front-trends/18984037350/in/album-72157654676120940/lightbox/">sharp</a> LED screen, but if you’re thinking of reusing your content on other occasions, it’s good to use the <a href="">general rule</a> of presentation slides.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, <strong>send your presentation before</strong> the event and ask the organizers to test your slides or equipment on stage at the venue. It’s an easy way to prevent any catastrophic failures and get comfortable before the real thing.</p>

<h3>On the stage</h3>
<p>Be prepared for a lot of <strong>light</strong>. Depending on the conditions, you may or may not be able to see the audience well (or at all). There are <a href="">techniques</a> that will help you prepare for that situation. We’ll illuminate the audience and reduce the brightness of the stage lights for Q&amp;A sessions.</p>
<p>At Front-Trends, you will use a wireless <strong><a href="http://www.harriscomm.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/W/S/WS-MIC100.jpg">headset microphone</a></strong>, which gives you the most freedom on the stage, and also provides the best quality sound for the audience (both present at the event and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPMx-Fp6lT0&list=PLBevk0eXLOGfkVhE7PArRg6nKHqmMKgtB">online</a>). Once set up by our technical team, you can forget about the mic, and focus on your talk. There will always be someone to help you at the stage, if any technical problems occur.</p>

<h2>Final thought</h2>
<p>Please remember Front-Trends has a <a href="http://2015.front-trends.com/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a> and while we haven’t encountered any issues with conduct since first launching in 2010, we really mean what it says.</p>
