# Speaking at Front-Trends

## Tips from the organizers

Whether you become a Front-Trends speaker or not, the tips below will be useful for any speaking gig in the future.

### Technicalities
Never depend on conference Wi-Fi connection. Live coding and demoing is tricky. Once you’ve lost your flow, it’s difficult to recover. Yet, there are amazing examples of live coding sessions. Just make sure you have a backup plan offline, and prepare screencasts that can be rapidly switched to if you encounter problems.
Provide enough contrast in your slides, use a reasonable amount of text, and keep it big and bold. We’ll display them on a big, bright and sharp LED screen, but if you’re thinking of reusing your content on other occasions, it’s good to use the general rule of presentation slides.
Whenever possible, send your presentation before the event and ask the organizers to test your slides or equipment on stage at the venue. It’s an easy way to prevent any catastrophic failures and get comfortable before the real thing.

### On the stage
Be prepared for a lot of light. Depending on the conditions, you may or may not be able to see the audience well (or at all). There are techniques that will help you prepare for that situation. We’ll illuminate the audience and reduce the brightness of the stage lights for Q&A sessions.
At Front-Trends, you will use a wireless headset microphone, which gives you the most freedom on the stage, and also provides the best quality sound for the audience (both present at the event and online). Once set up by our technical team, you can forget about the mic, and focus on your talk. There will always be someone to help you at the stage, if any technical problems occur.
